      <h1>BENEFITS OF PLAYING VOLLEYBALL</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="text-center">created by: Muhammad Azrul bin Mosri<br>24 September 2020</p>
    <h2 class="text-justify">1. Burns Fat and Calories</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">It helps to burn off calories, one of the best advantages of playing volleyball. As a consequence, a positive ratio of muscle and fat can be effectively preserved by your body. It has been calculated that only half an hour of competitive volleyball will burn 120 to 178 calories anywhere while 90 to 133 calories can be burned off in a less competitive game. Volleyball is a perfect way to reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes and hypertension by maintaining a healthy weight.</p>
    <h2 class="text-justify">2. Builds and Tones Muscles</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">The physical movements used while playing volleyball help to develop the upper and lower body muscles. When passing the ball, you squat and use your legs for strength, and use your hands, arms and legs to set the ball up. Because playing volleyball needs continuous use of the arms and legs, you get the advantages of a full body workout efficiently! You will gain the added advantage of toning your muscles, in addition to building strength and strengthening your respiratory and cardiovascular systems.</p>

     <h2 class="text-justify">3. Improved Mental Health</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">You will reinforce friendships and experience a sense of community cohesion when you participate in a volleyball tournament at our Smoky Mountain sports complex and work together with your squad to accomplish a common goal. Group sports are also a perfect way to boost trust in yourself and alleviate tension. The positive emotions you get from playing volleyball will also move off the court to other areas of your life!</p>
    <h2 class="text-justify">4. Builds Coordination, Balance, and Speed</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">New players in volleyball develop their coordination, balance, and pace rapidly. Many of these essential skills are included in the sport, since the game consists of serving, passing, setting, blocking, and much more. These important abilities are constantly used in volleyball games to be successful, so with each match you will find yourself developing these abilities more!</p>
    <h2 class="text-justify">5. Increased Aerobic Activity</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">Although it might sound shocking, research has shown that someone playing a slow 20-minute volleyball game can use the same amount of energy as a person jogging for a mile. By playing a more intense volleyball game, you use the same amount of energy as someone jogging a mile in just 12 minutes! Longer and more competitive games have significant health benefits that are even greater.</p>
