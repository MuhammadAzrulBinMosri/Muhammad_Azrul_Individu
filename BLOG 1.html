      <h1>HISTORY OF VOLLEYBALL</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="text-center">created by: Muhammad Azrul bin Mosri<br>30 September 2019</p>
    <p>Volleyball is a game played by two teams, usually six players on one side, in which the players use their hands to bat a ball back and forth over a high net, attempting to make the ball hit the court inside the playground of the opponents until it can be returned. A player on the opposing team bats the ball up and towards a teammate until it hits the court surface to avoid this, so the teammate can either volley it back across the net or bat it to a third teammate who volleys it across the net. Just three touches of the ball are permitted to a team before it must be returned to the net.</p>
    <p>William G. Morgan, Physical Director of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Massachusetts, invented volleyball in 1895. For businessmen who considered the modern game of basketball too vigorous, it was planned as an indoor sport. Morgan named the sport "mintonette," before the volleyball nature of play was noticed by a professor from Springfield College in Massachusetts and suggested the name of "volleyball." The initial rules were written by Morgan and printed in the first edition of the Young Men's Christian Associations of North America's Official Handbook of the Athletic League. In schools, playgrounds, the armed forces, and other organisations in the United States, the game soon proved to have broad appeal for both sexes, and it was eventually spread to other nations.</p>

    <p>The YMCA and the National Collegiate Athletic Association jointly released legislation in 1916. In1922, the National YMCA Physical Education Committee in New York City organised the first national tournament in the United States. The United States Volleyball Association (USVBA) was founded in 1928 and is recognised in the United States as the governing body for rules-making.</p>
    <p>Since 1928, with the exception of 1944 and1945, the USVBA, now known as USA Volleyball (USAV), has organised annual national men's and senior men's (age 35 and older) volleyball championships. In1949, the women's division began, and in1977, a senior women's division (aged 30 and older) was added. In the United States, other national activities are carried out by affiliate organisations of the USAV, such as the YMCA and the NCAA.</p>
    <p>During World War I, when national organisations were established, volleyball was brought into Europe by American troops. Founded in 1947 in Paris, the Fédération Internationale de Volley Ball (FIVB) moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1984. The USVBA was one of the 13 FIVB founding members, whose membership by the late 20th century had expanded to more than 210 member countries.</p>
    <p>The first Far East Games, in Manila, started in 1913 with the international volleyball tournament. Volleyball in Asia was played on a larger court, with a lower net, and nine players on a team during the early 1900s and continued until after World War II.</p>
